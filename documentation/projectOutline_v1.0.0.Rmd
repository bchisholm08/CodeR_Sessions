# Step-by-Step Project Guide: Building an R Coding Practice Website

## Introduction

This guide provides a step-by-step breakdown for creating your R coding practice website. The goal is to 
combine web scraping to collect open-source datasets with interactive tutorials that allow users to practice R. 
Below, you will find an organized plan, suggested file names, a directory structure, and tips for managing a long-term project. 
This document is aimed at guiding you from the initial setup to full deployment.

## Project Overview

- **Technology Stack**: R (backend, data processing), 
learnr (interactive tutorials), 
HTML/CSS/JavaScript (frontend styling), 
Shiny (interactive components), and 
GitHub (version control and deployment).

- **Project Goals**:
  - Web scraping for open datasets.
  - Creating interactive R tutorials using learnr.
  - Hosting the project for users to access and practice R skills.
  - Integrate Shiny apps for interactive data analysis and visualization.

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. **Initial Setup**

- **Create the Project Directory**: Start by creating the main folder `RStudio_codeR_sessions`.
- **Initialize Git**: Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory. Run:
  ```sh
  git init
  git remote add origin https://github.com/bchisholm08/CodeR_Sessions.git
  ```
- **Create Initial Files**:
  - Create a `README.md` in the `docs/` folder to document your project.
  - Set up the folder structure as outlined above.
  - Add a `.gitignore` file to ignore unnecessary files (e.g., `.Rhistory`, `.RData`).

### 2. **Web Scraping Component**

- **Web Scraper Script**:
  - Create the `scripts/scrape_dataset.R` file.
  - Use the provided code to set up a web scraping function using `rvest` and `httr`.
  - **Example Code**:
    ```r
    library(rvest)
    library(httr)
    
    scrape_dataset <- function(url, css_selector, output_path) {
      tryCatch({
        page <- read_html(url)
        dataset_link <- page %>%
          html_nodes(css_selector) %>%
          html_attr('href') %>%
          .[1] 
        if (startsWith(dataset_link, "/")) {
          dataset_link <- paste0(url, dataset_link)
        }
        GET(dataset_link, write_disk(output_path, overwrite = TRUE))
        message("Dataset successfully scraped and saved at: ", output_path)
      }, error = function(e) {
        message("Failed to scrape the dataset: ", e$message)
      })
    }
    ```
- **Enhance the Scraper**:
  - Modify the function to loop through multiple URLs to scrape multiple datasets in one run.
  - Add logging functionality to keep track of successfully scraped datasets by creating a `logs/` folder to store logs.
  - **Logging Example**:
    ```r
    log_scrape <- function(message) {
      log_file <- "logs/scrape_log.txt"
      write(paste(Sys.time(), "-", message), file = log_file, append = TRUE)
    }
    ```
- **Automate Scraping**:
  - Set up a cron job (Linux/macOS) or Task Scheduler (Windows) to run the scraping script periodically.
  - Alternatively, use GitHub Actions to automate the scraping at set intervals.

### 3. **Data Management**

- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Create a script `scripts/data_cleaning.R` to clean and preprocess datasets after scraping.
  - Use packages like `dplyr` and `tidyr` to handle missing values, filter data, and transform variables.
  - **Example Data Cleaning Workflow**:
    ```r
    library(dplyr)
    library(tidyr)
    
    clean_data <- function(input_path, output_path) {
      data <- read.csv(input_path)
      cleaned_data <- data %>%
        filter(!is.na(variable)) %>%
        mutate(new_variable = as.factor(old_variable))
      write.csv(cleaned_data, output_path, row.names = FALSE)
      message("Data cleaned and saved at: ", output_path)
    }
    ```
- **Storage**:
  - Save raw datasets in the `data/raw/` folder and cleaned datasets in the `data/cleaned/` folder.
  - Add metadata (e.g., source, scraped date) to track dataset origins. Consider creating a `metadata.csv` file to document each dataset.

### 4. **Interactive Tutorials**

- **Create learnr Tutorials**:
  - In the `tutorials/` folder, create `data_exploration.Rmd`.
  - Use `learnr` to build interactive exercises that load datasets from the `data/cleaned/` folder.
  - **Example Exercise**:
    ```r
    ```{r}
    library(learnr)
    
    tutorial("Data Exploration Tutorial") {
      text("Welcome to the data exploration tutorial! Let's start by loading the dataset.")
      exercise("Load the dataset", "data <- read.csv('data/cleaned/scraped_dataset.csv')", "data")
    }
    ```
- **Expand Tutorial Features**:
  - Add exercises on data cleaning using `dplyr`, data visualization using `ggplot2`, and basic data analysis.
  - Include hints or solution reveals to guide users through difficult exercises.
  - **Add a Quiz**: Use `learnr::question()` to include quizzes that reinforce the material covered.

### 5. **Frontend Development**

- **User Interface**:
  - Use **Shiny** to create an interactive interface that users can use to practice R coding.
  - Add custom styles using `www/style.css` for a polished and professional look.
  - **Suggested Shiny App Components**:
    - **Dataset Selector**: Allow users to select different datasets for analysis.
    - **Code Editor**: Embed an R code editor for real-time coding practice.
    - **Visualization Panel**: Show output plots or tables based on user inputs.
- **Deployment Preparation**:
  - Test Shiny apps locally to ensure all components work together smoothly.
  - Use `shiny::runApp()` to run the app locally and check for bugs or errors.

### 6. **Testing and Quality Assurance**

- **Unit Testing**:
  - Add unit tests to `tests/test_scraping.R` to verify that the scraper works for different URL formats and correctly handles errors.
  - **Test Example**:
    ```r
    library(testthat)
    
    test_that("Scraper works correctly", {
      expect_error(scrape_dataset("invalid_url", "css_selector", "output.csv"))
      expect_message(scrape_dataset("https://example.com", ".dataset-link", "output.csv"), "Dataset successfully scraped")
    })
    ```
- **User Testing**:
  - Invite friends or colleagues to use the tutorials and provide feedback on usability.
  - Implement a feedback form within the Shiny app to collect input from users.

### 7. **Deployment**

- **Hosting Options**:
  - Deploy the Shiny app using **Shinyapps.io** or **RStudio Connect** for easy access.
  - Alternatively, use **GitHub Pages** for a static frontend and link to Shiny apps for dynamic features.
- **Continuous Integration**:
  - Set up **GitHub Actions** to automate scraping, cleaning, and testing.
  - **Deployment Automation**: Automate deployment using GitHub Actions to ensure the latest version is always available online.

### 8. **Documentation and Community Engagement**

- **README.md**:
  - Provide installation instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines in `docs/README.md`.
  - Include badges for build status and other key project indicators.
- **User Guides**:
  - Add detailed user guides to the `docs/user_guide.md` covering how to run tutorials, scrape new datasets, and contribute to the project.
- **GitHub Community**:
  - Enable Discussions to allow users to share feedback, ask questions, and suggest new features.
  - Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` to outline how others can contribute.
  - Set up issues for feature requests, bugs, and enhancements to foster an active community.
