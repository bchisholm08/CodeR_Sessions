### README for CodeR_Sessions

This repository is the home base for the CodeR_Sessions project. 
#
The CodeR_Sessions is an open sourced project to help people practice statistics and coding in R. 

Once built and running, the website will scrape the web for data sets and 
automatically create research questions surrounding the dataset so that the user 
has some direction. Once one of these combinations is found and satisfied,
the website will save it as a query. This is essentially a question prompt that has both a dataset
and questions already. 

Users will be able to post solutions to queries created by the website and compare answers or ask for help. 

For example if there is a query generated by the site with NFL data with questions about running back yards per rush, 
that page will be titled and given a specific problem code for other users to reference. 

Once a user has coded their solution, they will have the option to post it. 

Users may also upload their own datasets to the website and create custom queries that others may try.
