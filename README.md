### README for CodeR_Sessions

This repository is the home base for the CodeR_Sessions project. 
#
The CodeR_Sessions is an open sourced project to help people practice statistics and coding in R. 

Once built and running, the website will scrape the web for data sets and 
automatically create research questions surrounding the dataset so that the user 
has some direction from the beginning. Once one of these combinations is found and satisfied,
the website will save it as a query. This is essentially a question prompt that has both a dataset
and questions already. 

Users will be able to post their solutions to specific queries created by the website and compare answers or ask for help.
