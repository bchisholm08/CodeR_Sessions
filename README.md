The CodeR-Sessions is an open sourced project to help people practice statistics and coding in R. 

The website will scrape the web for data sets and 
automatically generate research questions (RQ) about the dataset so that the user 
has some direction. Once a combination of data and RQ's is found and satisfied,
the website will save it as a query. This is essentially a question prompt that has both a dataset
and RQ's.  

An example query could be generated with NFL data containing questions about running back yards per rush. That page will be titled and given a specific problem code number for other users to reference. 

Users will be able to post their solutions to generated queries to compare answers or ask for help.

Once a user has coded their solution, they will have the option to post it to the corresponding query page. 

Users may upload their own datasets and create custom queries from a template to challenge other users. User generated queries will also be assigned a problem code number and saved for others to try out!
